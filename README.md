# Cloud Foundry R Buildpack

Forked from [Heroku R buildpack](https://github.com/virtualstaticvoid/heroku-buildpack-r) to support Cloud Foundry. Works with R 3.2.4. Tested with Shiny. 

Live example: https://rshinyapp.cfapps.io:4443

Caveat: JDK / rJava is not supported. Cloud Foundry prefers JRE over JDK.
